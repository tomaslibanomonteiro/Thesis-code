# Single and Multi Objective Optimization in Python - a Desktop Application

This project aimed at creating a friendly **Graphical User Interface** for Single and Multi Objective Optimization in python, over the established optimization library, **pymoo** (https://pymoo.org/index.html). It was done in light of the Master Thesis Dissertation by Tomás Líbano Monteiro in Técnico University (insert link #!).

It provides an interface capable of running multiple Algorithms on multiple Problems with a single click of a button. The results can be presented through multiple performance indicators, and various visualization techniques. 

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine through the command, or just download the zip file and extract it to a directory of your choice.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/tomaslibanomonteiro/Thesis-code #!
```

2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies (creation of a virtual environment is recommended).

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Application

Run the main.py file to start the application.

```bash
python main.py
```


### Integration of personalized code

An example of how to add user coded Algorithms, Problems, or other Classes into the App, is exemplified in the *integrate_user_classes.py* file.
