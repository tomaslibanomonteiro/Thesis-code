# Single and Multi Objective Optimization in Python - a Desktop Application

This project aimed at creating a friendly **Graphical User Interface** for Single and Multi Objective Optimization in python, over the established optimization library, **pymoo** (https://pymoo.org/index.html). It was done in light of the Master Thesis Dissertation by Tomás Líbano Monteiro in Técnico University (insert link #!).

It provides an interface capable of running multiple Algorithms on multiple Problems with a single click of a button. The results can be presented through multiple performance indicators, and various visualization techniques.
